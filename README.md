# Sloppy-compressor

This project contains the implementations for 2 compression algorithms.

One algorithm is an implementation of lz77, the other is my own creation that more often than
not makes files larger than when you originally started.

This is a toy project for getting up to speed on writing Rust and isn't intended for any
serious use.
